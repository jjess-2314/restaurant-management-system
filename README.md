Mini project using Python and SQL for managing restaurant operations
🍽 Restaurant Management System

Welcome to my Restaurant Management System project! This beginner-friendly project is built using Python and SQL Server, designed to efficiently handle restaurant data, including menu items, orders, and billing. It is part of my journey into the world of data analytics and backend development.



 📌 Project Overview

This project is a command-line-based system that simulates the basic functionalities of a restaurant. It allows you to:

- Add and manage menu items
- Take customer orders
- Generate bills
- Store and retrieve order data from a *SQL Server* database

Built with simplicity in mind, it showcases how Python can be connected with a SQL database to build real-world systems.



🛠 Tech Stack

- *Python* – for backend logic and user interaction
- *SQL Server* – for storing and retrieving restaurant data
- *PyCharm* – as the development IDE
